# tinyrenderer

This is a (in progress) Rust implementation of the excellent rendering tutorial [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki). Want to do it yourself? Feel free to copy `src/img.rs` into your own project, it just implements a very simple image drawing and saving library, very boring stuff. But don't copy `main.rs`, that's cheating!
